\begin{abstract}

Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have helped improve the
performance of the DL-based Automated Program Repair (APR) approaches.
The bug-fixing code changes in APR often depend on the surrounding
code context. Despite successes, the state-of-the-art DL-based APR
approaches are still limited in {\em integrating context learning and
code-transformation learning}, leading to their ineffectiveness in
fixing {\em context-dependent bugs}. Moreover, in those approaches,
the cascading architecture from a code context-learning model (CCL) to
a code-transformation learning model (CTL) possibly leads to the
confounding inaccuracies.
%
In this work, we introduce {\bf \tool}, a context-aware dual-task learning
APR model, that exploits the duality of those two dedicated models to
explicitly propagate the mutual impacts of CCL and CTL onto one
another. Instead of cascading CCL $\rightarrow$ CTL, we train them
simultaneously with soft-sharing parameters via a cross-stitch unit
for explicit propagation of the impacts to improve the accuracy of
both tasks.

%Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have helped improve the
%performance of the DL-based Automated Program Repair (APR) approaches.
%The bug-fixing changes in APR often depend on the surrounding code
%context. Despite their successes, the state-of-the-art DL-based APR
%approaches still have limitations in the integration of code contexts
%in learning bug fixes. The limitations lead to the ineffectiveness of
%those DL-based approaches in learning to auto-fix context-dependent
%bugs. In this work, we conjecture that correct learning of contexts
%can benefit the learning of code transformations and vice versa in
%APR. We introduce {\tool}, a context-aware dual learning APR model,
%which dedicates one model to learn the bug-fixing code transformations
%(CTL) and another one to learn the corresponding surrounding code
%contexts (CCL) for the transformations. Instead of cascading them, we
%train them simultaneously with soft-sharing parameters via a
%cross-stitch unit to explicitly model the impacts of contexts on
%fixing learning and vice versa.

We conducted several experiments to evaluate {\tool} on three
different datasets: Defects4J~\cite{defects4j} (395 bugs),
Bugs.jar~\cite{saha2018bugs} (1,158 bugs), and
BigFix~\cite{yioopsla19} (+4.9M methods and 1.8M buggy ones).  We
compared {\tool} against several state-of-the-art DL-based APR
tools. Our results show that {\tool} can fix 16.7\%, 12.1\%, and
14.6\% more bugs than the best-performance DL-based baseline model
with only the top-1 patches in Defects4J, Bugs.jar, and BigFix,
respectively. In Defects4J, it improves over the baseline models from
16.7\%--194.7\%. In Bugs.jar and BigFix, it fixes 26.4\% and 27.7\% of
the total fixed bugs that were missed by the best DL-based baseline.
