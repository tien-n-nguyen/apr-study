\subsection{\bf RQ1. Comparison with DL-based APR Approaches on Defects4J Dataset.}

Table~\ref{RQ1_defect4j} shows that {\em {\tool} can auto-fix more bugs
than any studied deep-learning-based baselines}. Specifically, {\tool}
can automatically fix 56 bugs and it fixes {\bf 194.7\% (i.e., 37), 40\%
(i.e., 16), 27.3\% (i.e., 12), and 16.7\% (i.e., 8)} more bugs than the
baseline models SequenceR, DLFix, CoCoNuT, and CURE,
respectively. Furthermore, {\tool} generates {\em the most plausible
patches (i.e., 96)} passing all test cases than any other baselines,
indicating that {\tool} has a better patch generation
capability. Moreover, {\tool} has a {\em higher percentage of the generated
plausible patches to be correct than all the baselines}, except
SequenceR. However, {\tool} can fix 194\% more bugs and 6 times more
plausible patches than SequenceR.
