\subsection{Research Questions}

For evaluation, we seek to answer the following research questions:

\noindent\textbf{RQ1. Comparison with the state-of-the-art deep learning
  (DL)-based APR approaches on Defects4J dataset.}  How well does
                {\tool} perform compared with those approaches?

%                the state-of-the-art DL-based automate program repair
%                approaches on Defects4J dataset?


\noindent\textbf{RQ2. Comparison with the state-of-the-art DL-based APR Approaches on large datasets.}  
How does {\tool} perform compared with the DL-based APR models on large datasets?


\noindent\textbf{RQ3. Overlapping Analysis.} How many bugs does
{\tool} can fix, but the other DL-based baselines
                missed and vice versa?

\noindent\textbf{RQ4. Impact Analysis of Dual-Task Learning.} How does
dual-task learning affect the overall performance of {\tool}?


\noindent\textbf{RQ5. Evaluation on C/C++ Projects.} How does {\tool} perform on C/C++ projects?
