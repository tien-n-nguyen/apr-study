\subsection{Threats to Validity}
The threats of this paper come from the following aspects: 
(1) We evaluated our {\tool} on Java and C/C++ code. 
The key modules in {\tool} are language-independent and can be applied to
other types of programming languages. 
(2) We re-implemented CURE as its code was publicly available online and also the authors of CURE never replied our emails. We tried our best to follow the details in their paper during the implementation. 
%(3) 


%The compared baselines and FixLocator require a dataset with test cases for generating code coverage information, run-time information, and failing traces, thus we only compared them on Defects4J. In the future, we plan to test FixLocator on more types of datasets. 
%(3) The DeepFL is designed for method-level fault localization. To compare it with FixLocator fairly, we use only part of its features that are applicable to statement level fault localization. The other baselines CNNFL and DeepRL4FL can be directly applied on statement-level FL. 
%(4) To compare fairly, we evaluated the baselines using out proposed Hit-N@Set metrics. However, we also tested our FixLocator using the ranking metrics: Hit-N@Top-K. FixLocator is consistently better than all baselines in any metric.
