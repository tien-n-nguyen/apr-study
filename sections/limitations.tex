\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

{\tool} still has the following limitations. First, it fixes only
single-statement bugs. Second, it could not produce a fix with an
arbitrarily large size because it sets a limit with $P$ and $Q$ in the
size of the fixed subtree. Third, it does work well for the cases of
only inserting or deleting code. Fourth, {\tool} learns only the
tree-based code transformation, thus, has limitations in learning
program semantic changes involving complex program dependencies, etc.
